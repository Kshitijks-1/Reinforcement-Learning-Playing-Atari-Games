# Reinforcement-Learning-Playing-Atari-Games
Using various reinforcement learning algorithms(SARSA,Naive Q &amp; Deep Q Learning) to play "Atari Games" and Compare their performances.

Environments:
Taxi-V3
FrozenLake-v0

In this project , Two RL algorithms we have selected to compare their performance in this
project are SARSA, naive Q-learning on different Atari games, and analyze them in order
to identify factors which might influence the performance of these algorithms on
different types of environments.



Improvement

We can improve the performance by Deep Q-Learning using Experience Replay further
supports our hypothesis, as using Experience Replay allows it to use a history of states to
determine action, solving the problem of non-markovian property.
